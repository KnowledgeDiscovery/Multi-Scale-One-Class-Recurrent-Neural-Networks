# OC4Seq: 

The `OC4Seq` repository contains code for a multi-scale one-class recurrent neural network for detecting anomalies in discrete event sequences. The method implemented here is described in [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467125).

## Usage
- exp.py: This is the main experiment script
- model.py: The OC4Seq is implemented in the this file
- trainer.py: It implements the training producedure
- utils.py: It preprocesses the data for experiment
